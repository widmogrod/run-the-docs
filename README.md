**Core concepts:**

- [ ] **Language agnostic.** Generates documentation from any programming language.
- [ ] **Code is documentation.** Keeping documentation inlined in code makes it's easier to be in sync with actual state of the codebase.
- [ ] **Examples are tests.** Having examples as a test protects them from being outdate and therefore documentation from becoming obsolete.
